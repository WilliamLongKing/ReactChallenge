# React Challenge
This was a React challenge taken for a recruitment process, the task being to create a login page based on specific instructions and images.
The login page takes input for a username and password with validation (hard coded values for now), redirecting the user to a new page with a welcome message if successful. The welcome page contains their username (email since username is not specified to be different from email), and a data table of users from the JSON Placeholder endpoint.
