# React Challenge
This was a React challenge taken for a recruitment process, the task being to create a login page based on specific instructions and images.
The login page takes input for a username and password with validation (hard coded values for now), redirecting the user to a new page with a welcome message if successful. The welcome page contains their username (email since username is not specified to be different from email), and a data table of users from the JSON Placeholder endpoint.

# Instructions
To run the page, clone the repository and navigate to the root folder in the console. Run the command "npm start" to start the page, which will be available on localhost:3000 if possible. 
The correct login credentials are:
username: test@gmail.com
password: test123!

A means to navigate back to the login page was not specified, but the login page can be navigated back to using the browser back button.
